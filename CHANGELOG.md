### Changed

- After the end of an era the payout is triggered after a random waiting period (up to a maximum of 120 seconds). This aims to prevent a block race from all `crunch` bots at the beginning of each era.

- Fix parity default endpoints by defining port number
- Update metadata Polkadot runtime/9151

## [0.4.1] - 2022-01-14

### Changed

- Update metadata Westend runtime/9150
- Update metadata Kusama runtime/9150

## [0.4.0] - 2022-01-11

### Changed

- Changed single payouts for batch calls
- Update `subxt` dependency to revision `41bd8cc`

### Added

- Add `maximum-calls` flag with default value of 8. By default `crunch` collects all the outstanding payouts from previous eras and group all the extrinsic payout calls in group of 8 (or whatever value defined by this flag) so that a single batch call per group can be made. Using batch calls rather than single payouts we could expect a significant drop in transaction fees and a significat increase on `crunch` performance.

### Changed

## [0.3.2] - 2021-11-03

### Changed

- Update substrate-subxt dependency. Subscription to `EraPaid` event should now run as expected without panic events every session.
- Fix loading `CRUNCH_SUBSTRATE_WS_URL` environment from `.env` file
- Default `error-interval` time reduced to 5 min
- Note: Batch calls are still not supported on this version

## [0.3.0] - 2021-10-17

### Changed

- Fix substrate-subxt dependency with support for metadata v14
- Note: Batch calls are not supported on this version -> potentially on next release

## [0.2.2] - 2021-10-09

### Added

- Add `maximum_history_eras` flag with default value of 4. Note: This flag is only valid if `short` flag is also present. By default `crunch` will only check for unclaimed rewards in the last 4 eras rather than the last 84 as in previous versions. If running `crunch` in verbose mode the check in the last 84 eras still apply by default, since we would like to keep showing information regarding Inclusion and total Crunched eras for all history.

### Changed

- Fix loading configuration variables specified in `.env` file.
- Fix bug for new chains that have `current_era` value lower than `history_depth` constant.

## [0.2.1] - 2021-09-30
