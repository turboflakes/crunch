`crunch` is a command-line interface (CLI) to easily automate payouts of staking rewards on Substrate-based chains.

## Why use `crunch`

To claim staking rewards for just one or a list of Validators at the end of each Era or every X hours.

To get notified about the amount and rate of the total staking rewards each Validator and their Nominators got

To be informed about era stats for each Validator, e.g. inclusion rate, claimed rewards rate, era points trend, active for current era

To easily inspect about any unclaimed eras for a given Validator stash

To promote Validators by publicly publish their automated staking rewards to a public **Crunch Bot** room

For Nominators in private or public rooms check their chosen Validators rewards performance

For Pool Operators to ensure that all active validators selected - active pool nominees - payout on time. An additional guarantee for Pool members that Pool operatos act in members best interests.

For Pool Operators to auto-compound members rewards above certain threshold.

## Installation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create `crunch-bot` directory
mkdir /crunch-bot
# download `crunch` binary latest version
wget -P /crunch-bot https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/releases/download/v0.24.2/crunch
# make `crunch` binary file executable
chmod +x /crunch-bot/crunch
```

Note: Alternatively download [`crunch-update.sh`](https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/blob/main/crunch-update.sh) bash script file and make it executable. Easier installation and faster updates.

## Configuration

Create a configuration file `.env` inside `crunch-bot` folder and copy the default variables from [`.env.example`](https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/blob/main/.env.example) (Note: `.env` is the default name and a hidden file, if you want something different you can adjust it later with the option `crunch --config-path /crunch-bot/config_kusama.env` )

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create/open a file with a file editor (Vim in this case) and add/change the configuration
# variables with your own personal values
vi /crunch-bot/.env
# when ready write and quit (:wq!)
```

Create a seed private file `.private.seed` inside `crunch-bot` folder and write the private seed phrase of the account responsible to sign the extrinsic payout call as in [`.private.seed.example`](https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/blob/main/.private.seed.example) (Note: `.private.seed` is the default name and a hidden file, if you want something different you can adjust it later with the option `crunch flakes --seed-path ~/crunch-bot/.kusama.private.seed` )

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create a file with a file editor (Vim in this case) and write the private seed phrase
# of the account responsible to sign the extrinsic payout call
vi /crunch-bot/.private.seed
# when ready write and quit (:wq!)
```

### Configuration of _systemd_ service

A good idea is to run the tool as a `systemd` service. Based on the previous path configuration, here is an example for reference:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Kusama Crunch Bot

[Service]
ExecStart=/crunch-bot/crunch --config-path /crunch-bot/.env rewards era --seed-path /crunch-bot/.private.seed
Restart=always
RestartSec=15

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

### Crunch Bot ([Matrix](https://matrix.org/))

If you set up `crunch` on your server with a matrix user 👉  you get your own **Crunch Bot**.

To enable **Crunch Bot** you will need to create a specific account on Element or similar and  copy the values to the respective environment variables `CRUNCH_MATRIX_BOT_USER` and `CRUNCH_MATRIX_BOT_PASSWORD` like in the configuration example file [`.env.example`](https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/blob/main/.env.example). You may also want to set your regular matrix user to the environment variable `CRUNCH_MATRIX_USER`. So that **Crunch Bot** could create a private room and send in messages. By default **Crunch Bot** will automatically invite your regular matrix user to a private room. Also by default **Crunch Bot** will send a copy of the messages to the respective network public room for which is connected to.

### Public Rooms available

Join and read the messages history of all the Public Rooms for which **Crunch Bots** are sending messages:

### Crunch Bot messages

![crunch bot notification messages example](https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/blob/main/assets/matrix-example-512.png?raw=true)

## Usage

If you have been doing `crunch` configuration as described in previous steps (assuming `.env` and `.private.seed` defined inside `/crunch-bot` folder), run `crunch` when `/crunch-bot` folder is your current working directory. Otherwise you will have to specify `.env` and `.private.seed` custom paths.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# set /crunch-bot your current working directory
cd /crunch-bot
```

By default `crunch` tries to connect to your local substrate node on the default websocket port `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`. This can be changed by typing one of polkadot main chains - westend, kusama or polkadot. Or by changing the substrate websocket url with the option `--substrate-ws-url`.

`crunch` default sub command is `flakes`, there are fun messages if you stick with it, or you can choose the regular sub command `rewards` rather than `flakes`. As you prefer. Both sub commands are identical in terms of job execution. But logs, messages/notifications differ.

Essentially `crunch` motto is enjoy **Crunch Bot** while `crunch flakes` :)

If all has been set as previously described `crunch` should be ready with just the following options:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# if running a local node than simple run crunch with default options
# by default crunch will try to connect to ws://localhost:9944
# and claim staking rewards as soon as the current era finishes
crunch rewards
# or be specific to which network crunch will try to connect
crunch kusama rewards
# or for Polkadot network and claiming rewards once a day at a specific time
crunch polkadot rewards daily
# or for Westend network and claiming rewards every 6 hours at a specific time
crunch westend rewards turbo
# or just once and exit
crunch westend rewards once
# or for Westend network with unique stashes verified and for all configured pools nominees and claiming rewards every era
crunch westend --enable-unique-stashes rewards era --enable-pool-all-nominees-payout
# or to auto-compound members rewards of nomination pools you operate
crunch kusama rewards --enable-pool-members-compound
# or to know which ONE-T grade a validator got from the last 6 sessions
crunch kusama rewards --enable-onet-api
# or why not and try crunch with light client usage
crunch kusama --enable-light-client rewards once
# or try flakes just for fun :)
crunch flakes
# to list all options try help
crunch help
```

If you need more customization run help to check all sub commands, flags and options.

Note: All flags and options are also available through environment variables if defined in `.env` configuration file. You can choose which way you want to configure `crunch`. Take in consideration that if the same variable is defined on both sides e.g. defined in `.env` and through CLI flag/option, `crunch` will take the value defined by CLI.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# if you need a custom crunch check all the options and flags available
crunch help

            Define the number of blocks the transaction is mortal for (default is 64 blocks)

        --tx-tip <tx-tip>
            Define a tip in PLANCKS for the block author.


ARGS:
    <MODE>    Sets how often staking rewards should be claimed from unclaimed eras. (e.g. the option 'era' sets
              'crunch' task to run as soon as the EraPaid on-chain event is triggered; the option 'daily' sets
              'crunch' task to be repeated every 24 hours; option 'turbo' sets 'crunch' task to be repeated every 6
              hours;option 'once' tries to run the payout once and exit;) [default: era]  [possible values: era,
              daily, turbo, once]
```

Note: By default `crunch` collects the outstanding payouts from previous eras and group all the extrinsic payout calls in group of 4 or whatever value defined in the flag `maximum-calls` so that a single batch call per group can be made. The collection of all outstanding payouts from previous eras is also limited by 2 other flags. The first being `maximum-payouts` which default value is 4, this flag limits the number of payouts **per stash**. The other one is the `maximum-history-eras` which default is also 4, this flag limits the number of past eras `crunch` will look for unclaimed rewards - but this flag only applies if `short` flag is also used in the configuration. This is done so that `crunch` can run efficiently every era.

With that said, if it's the **first time** you are running `crunch` and you are not sure if you have any unclaimed rewards or if you just want to know for the stash accounts defined in the confguration file (`.env`), which eras from the last 84 have already been claimed or unclaimed, you can simply run `crunch view`.

Note: The `crunch view` mode only logs information into the terminal.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# log unclaimed rewards for Westend network
crunch westend view
# or for Kusama network
crunch kusama view
# or for Polkadot network
crunch polkadot view
```

Note: You can run `crunch` inside a tmux session and leave it, or using something like `systemd` to run `crunch` on server restarts for example. By default `crunch` will wake up every X hours to claim rewards if there are any to claim.

## Development / Build from Source

If you'd like to build from source, first install Rust.

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

If Rust is already installed run

```bash
rustup update
```

Verify Rust installation by running

```bash
rustc --version
```

Once done, finish installing the support software

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git clang libclang-dev pkg-config libssl-dev
```

Build `crunch` by cloning this repository

```bash
#!/bin/bash
git clone http://github.com/turboflakes/crunch
```

Compile `crunch` package with Cargo

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cargo build
```

And then run it

```bash
#!/bin/bash
./target/debug/crunch westend flakes daily
```

Otherwise, recompile the code on changes and run the binary

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cargo watch -x 'run --bin crunch'
```

### Downloading metadata from a Substrate node

Use the [`subxt-cli`](./cli) tool to download the metadata for your target runtime from a node.

Install
```bash
cargo install subxt-cli
```
Save the encoded metadata to a file
```bash
subxt metadata --url https://westend-rpc.polkadot.io  -f bytes > westend_metadata.scale
```
(Optional) Generate runtime API client code from metadata
```bash
subxt codegen --url https://westend-rpc.polkadot.io | rustfmt --edition=2018 --emit=stdout > westend_runtime.rs
```

## Docker

`crunch` can also be built and run from a Docker container.

Build docker container by cloning repo and building from source:

```bash
git clone http://github.com/turboflakes/crunch
cd crunch
docker build -t localhost/crunch .
```

Or build a docker container with the latest pre-built Alpine binary available:

```bash
docker build -t localhost/crunch -f Dockerfile.alpine .
```

Run Container

```bash
docker run --rm -it localhost/crunch:latest --version
```

The config and seed files can be mounted from the host. Any options supported by `crunch` can be added.

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --volume=/etc/env:/.env:ro \
  --volume=/etc/private.seed:/.private.seed:ro \
  localhost/crunch:latest \
    --config-path /.env kusama rewards daily -f /.private.seed
```

Or via Docker Compose [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) to easily run `crunch` in a container.

```bash
# start detached service
docker compose up -d
# follow logs
docker compose logs -f
# stop service
docker compose down
```
